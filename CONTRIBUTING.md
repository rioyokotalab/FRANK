# Logs and conclusions

Logs and conclusions for meetings taking place:

** 8 Aug 2018**

Meeting between Sameer and Peter.

Make a simple MPI code for the current class structure.

The code will have the following features:
* Make a basic code that is split across 4 processes.
* Don't make it block cyclic. Instead, keep it cyclic and simply split 4 blocks across 4 processes.
* If there is further split down any level, it stays on the same processor.
* We do not handle recursively split multi-process blocks at this point of time.
* Run this through Yokota sensei and set timeline.
